# Biological-Neural-Network-Simulations
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that simulate various neural networks using biologically plausible models. The simulations use spiking neural networks (SNNs) with detailed explanations linking the computational models to biological concepts.

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide educational and research-oriented Jupyter Notebooks that model different regions of the brain using spiking neural networks. These models incorporate realistic neuron dynamics, synaptic plasticity mechanisms like spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), and network connectivity patterns found in the brain.

## Installation

To run the notebooks in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- Brian2
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install brian2 numpy matplotlib
